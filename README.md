# Emergency_Room_Visit_Dashboard

## Problem Objective / Statement:
This healthcare interactive dashboard is aimed to delve into below critical metrics to understand their patients visit better:
1. Average Satisfaction Score
2. Average Wait Times
3. Total Patients Visit by:
    - Gender
    - Week Type
    - Age Group
    - Administrative versus Non-Administrative Appointment
    - Referral versus Walk-In
    - Department Referral
    - Month and Year

Above comprehensive approach not only sheds light but also empowers informed decision-making to drive continuous improvement.

 ## Valuable Insights

### [1] Patient Satisfaction Analysis:
- The average satisfaction score currently stands at 5.47.
- AM (Morning) satisfaction score averages at 5.45, while PM (Afternoon) satisfaction score slightly higher at 5.50.

The average satisfaction score indicates room for improvement, particularly considering that approxmiately 75% of patients have not rated the service. 
Implementing an action plan to enhance satisfaction level is imperative.

### [2] Wait Time Insights:
- On average, the patients wait 35.26 minutes before seeing a doctor.
- AM (Morning) wait time is 35.53 minutes, while PM (Afternoon) wait time is 34.93 minutes.

Patients typically wait around 35 minutes, slightly exceeding the optimal 30 minutes waiting time benchmark. We can streamline processes and reduce wait times to improve the overall patient experience.

### [3] Patient Visits Overview:
- Total number of patient visits recorded: 9,626.
- Gender distribution and the percentage of administrative versus non-administrative visits are nearly equal.
- Referred patients account for a higher percentage compared to Walk-In patients, with a difference of at least 10%.
- Adults constitute the primary age group, while infants represents the least.
- February records the lowest visit count, while August emerges as the peak month. However, when analyzed by AM and PM, May and June show the highest visits, respectively.
